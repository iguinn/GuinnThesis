\item[\znbb] neutrinoless double-beta decay
\item[HPGe] High Purity Germanium
\item[PPC] P-type Point Contact
\item[AvsE] A parameter calculated for PPC HPGe detector waveforms that compares the maximum current amplitude of a waveform to the energy of the waveform. If the current falls below a certain threshold for a given energy, it will be tagged as a \mssd.
\item[\Md] An event that involves near-simultaneous hits to more than one detector
\item[\Msmd] An event that hits multiple different, distinguishable points within the \MJD\ HPGe detector array. These points can be within the same detector (i.e.~\mssd s) or across multiple detectors (i.e.~\md s). To be distinguishable, these points must be separated by more than a few mm.
\item[\Mssd] A detector hit in which multiple distinguishable points within a single detector are hit simultaneously. To be distinguishable, these points must be separated by more than a few mm's. The AvsE parameter can be used to distinguish \mssd from single-site events, although some \mssd s, especially those in which each site lies on the same isochron, may be mistaken for single-site.
