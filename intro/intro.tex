\acknowledgments{
  I want to thank all the people who have helped me over the last seven years.
  Jason Detwiler has been an encouraging advisor and an excellent mentor who has given me every opportunity to succeed as a scientist and helped me to find the confidence to earn a Ph.D.
  I also want to thank the rest of the CENPA \MJ\ group, especially Micah Buuck, Julieta Gruszko, Clint Wiseman, Clara Cuesta, Walter Pettus, Nick Ruof, Alex Hostiuc; you have all been pleasure to work and have tought me a lot.
  Thanks to Alejandro Garcia and Nikolai Tolich for giving me the opportunity to work with them prior to landing in the \MJ\ group. What I learned from both of you has been invaluable during my Ph.D. work.
  Also thanks to the CENPA and UW staff that have helped along the way: David Peterson, Duncan Prindle, Gary Holman and Catherine Provost.
  I want to thank all of my friends that have been around at various points over the last seven years.
  Thanks to my parents, Doug and Judy Guinn, for loving me and encouraging me to do what I enjoy, encouraging my interest in science and giving me support these last 29~years.
