abstract = "Geant4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."

The analysis of various possible transitions to excited final states is based on coincidence events between pairs of detectors where a de-excitation γ ray is detected in one detector and the two electrons in the other. No signal has been observed and an event counting profile likelihood analysis has been used to determine Frequentist 90% C.L. bounds for three transitions:

The excited states are assumed to have the structure of one or two QRPA phonons. The 2νββ decay of 76Se and 136Ba, as well as some electromagnetic observables, are discussed as an application of the present formalism. The calculations have been performed using realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction and explicit summation over the virtual states of the intermediate nucleus. It is found that contrary to the decay to the ground state, the decay rate to the excited states is only very weakly dependent upon the strength of the particle-particle channel of the two-body interaction. This makes these decays more independent of the parametrization of the residual interaction and thus attractive in view of comparison with experimental data."

We find satisfactory agreement with data when we tried to describe unitarily, with the same set of parameters, all the computed physical quantities. The sum rule, which is fulfilled accurately in the framework of the proton-neutron QRPA, is violated insignificantly by our method. The higher-order QRPA terms only influence the β+ strengths which enter the double-beta decay rate formula, shifting them to higher QRPA energies."

In this extension, the multiple commutator model (MCM), a simultaneous treatment of the double-odd and double-even nuclei is possible by assuming their states to have the structure of one or two QRPA phonons. The MCM calculation is done for nine 2νβ−β− decays and six 2νECEC decays, and systematics of the relevant matrix elements and half-lives have been created. The study of the 2νββ-decay rates is complemented with the MCM study of the single-beta-decay properties of the relevant nuclei within the double-beta isobaric chains. The Woods-Saxon single-particle energies have been corrected near the Fermi surface by comparing the BCS quasiparticle energies with spectroscopic data of odd-mass nuclei. Pairing gaps, energy systematics of the Gamow-Teller states and the available beta-decay data have been used to obtain effective, model-space adapted, two-body matrix elements starting from the G-matrix elements of the Bonn one-boson-exchange potential. This enables a parameter-free calculation of the double Gamow-Teller matrix elements and theoretical prediction of double-beta half-lives."

title = {Small-angle Compton Scattering to Determine the Depth of a Radioactive Source in Matter},
author = {Oberer, R. B. and Gunn, C. A. and Chiang, L. G. and Valiga, R. E. and Cantrell, J. A.},
abstractNote = {A gamma-ray peak in a spectrum is often accompanied by a discontinuity in the Compton continuum at the peak. The Compton continuum results from Compton scattering in the detector. The discontinuity at a peak results from small-angle Compton scattering by the gamma rays in matter situated directly between the gamma-ray source and the detector. The magnitude of this discontinuity with respect to the gamma-ray peak is therefore an indicator of the amount of material or shielding between the gamma-ray source and the detector. This small-angle scattering was used to determine the depth of highly-enriched uranium (HEU) solution standards in a concrete floor mockup. The empirical results of the use of this small-angle scattering discontinuity in a concrete floor experiment will be described. A Monte Carlo calculation of the experiment will also be described. In addition, the depth determined from small-angle scattering was used in conjunction with differential attenuation to more accurately measure the uranium content of the mockup. Following these empirical results, the theory of small-angle scattering will be discussed. The magnitude of the discontinuity compared to the peak count rate is directly related to the depth of the gamma-ray source in matter. This relation can be described by relatively simple mathematical expressions. This is the first instance that we are aware of in which the small-angle Compton scattering has been used to determine the depth of a radioactive source. Furthermore this is the first development of the theoretical expressions for the magnitude of the small-angle scattering discontinuity.},

abstract = {Summary.  The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis–Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},,
